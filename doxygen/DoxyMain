 *  \section geninfo_sec Parallel programming in FastFlow
 *
 *  FastFlow (斋戒流) is a C++ parallel programming framework
 * advocating high-level, pattern-based parallel programming. It chiefly
 * supports streaming and data parallelism, targeting heterogenous
 * platforms composed of clusters of shared-memory platforms, possibly
 * equipped with computing accelerators such as NVidia GPGPUs, Xeon Phi,
 * Tilera TILE64.  
 *
 * The main design philosophy of FastFlow is to provide application
 * designers with key features for parallel programming
 * (e.g. time-to-market, portability, efficiency and performance
 * portability) via suitable parallel programming abstractions and a
 * carefully designed run-time support. 
 *
 *
 *  \section app_sec  Application scenarios
 *
 *  FastFlow is a general-purpose C++ programming framework for
 *  heterogenous parallel platforms. Like other high-level programming
 *  frameworks, such as Intel TBB and OpenMP, it simplifies the design
 *  and engineering of portable parallel applications. However, it has
 *  a clear edge in terms of expressiveness and performance with
 *  respect to other parallel programming frameworks in specific
 *  application scenarios, including, inter alia:
 * 
 * \li fine-grain parallelism on cache-coherent shared-memory platforms;
 * \li streaming applications;
 * \li coupled usage of multi-core and accelerators.
 *
 * In other cases FastFlow is typically comparable to (and is some
 * cases slightly faster than) state-of-the-art parallel programming
 * frameworks such as Intel TBB, OpenMP, Cilk, etc. More details may
 * be found on the performance page. A number of both micro-benchmarks
 * and real-world applications has been developed with FastFlow (or
 * ported from other parallel libraries) in order to asses its
 * usability and performance, among the others:
 * 
 * \li Bowtie2: fast and sensitive read alignment (multicore; porting of 
 * the original version developed with pthreads and spinlocks) 
 * \li Two-phase video/image restoration for impulsive/Gaussian noise 
 * (multicore, GPGPUs, heterogeneous; original algorithm)
 * \li Cholesky decomposition (multicore, porting of the PLASMA version)
 * \li Yadt C4.5 classifier (multicore; original algorithm)
 * \li CWC Gillespie simulator for systems biology (multicore, 
 * distributed, GPGPUs; original algorithm)
 * \li SWPS3: vectorized Smith-Waterman local alignment software 
 * (multicore; porting of the original version developed with pthreads)
 * \li pbzip2: Parallel BZIP2 (multicore; porting of the original version 
 * developed with POSIX processes)
 * \li Fast network deep packet inspection (multicore; original algorithm)
 * \li Several standard algorithms, such as nqueens, fibonacci, 
 * QT-mandebrot, matrix block multiplication, … (multicore, GPGPUs, 
 * distributed, heterogeneous) over 100 micro-benchmarks testing 
 * individual features and patterns (multicore, GPGPUs, distributed, 
 * heterogeneous)
 * 
 * The source code of (almost) all applications can be found in the 
 * FastFlow SVN repository under either LGPLv3 or GNU GPL license. 
 * The design of applications and their performance are described in 
 * research papers.
 *
 *  \section design_sec  Design
 * 
 * FastFlow comes as a C++ template library designed as a stack of
 * layers that progressively abstracts out the programming of parallel
 * applications. The goal of the stack is threefold: portability,
 * extensibility, and performance. For this, all the three layers are
 * realised as thin strata of C++ templates that are 1) seamlessly
 * portable; 2) easily extended via subclassing; and 3) statically
 * compiled and cross-optimised with the application. The terse design
 * ensures easy portability on almost all OSes and CPUs with a C++
 * compiler. The main development platform is Linux/x86_64/gcc, but it
 * has been tested also on various combinations of x86, x86_64, PPC,
 * ARM, Tilera, NVidia with gcc, icc, Visual Studio on Linux, Mac OS,
 * and Windows XP/7. The FastFlow core has been ported to ARM/iOS.

 *
 * The FastFlow run-time support uses several techniques to efficiently 
 * support fine grain parallelism (and very high frequency streaming). 
 * Among these are:
 *
 * \li non-blocking multi-threading with lock-less synchronisations;
 * \li zero-copy network messaging (via 0MQ/TCP and RDMA/Infiniband);
 * \li asynchronous data feeding for accelerator offloading.
 *
 * FastFlow has been adopted by a number of research projects and
 * third-party development initiatives, and has thus been tested in a
 * variety of application scenarios: from systems biology to
 * high-frequency trading.

  *  They are clearly characterised in a specific usage context and are

  * Examples are exploitation of loop parallelism, stream parallelism, 
  * data-parallel algorithms, execution of general workflows of tasks, etc. 
  * The are typically equipped with self-optimisation capabilities (e.g. 
  * load-balancing, grain auto-tuning, parallelism-degree auto-tuning) 
  * and exhibit no or limited nesting capability. Examples are: 
  * parallel-for, pipeline, stencil-reduce, mdf (macro-data-flow). 
  * Some of them targets specific devices (e.g. GPGPUs). 
  * They are implemented on top of core patterns.
