 *
 *  \section geninfo_sec General Information
 *
 *  FastFlow is essentially a C++ template library built on top of a non-blocking synchronisation mechanism.
 *  FastFlow is designed to ease the development of applications and make them very fast and scalable. It is
 *  particularly targeted to the development of streaming applications.
 *
 *
 *  \section layers_sec  Multi-layers framework
 *
 *  FastFlow is built upon a stack of layers that progressively abstract the shared memory parallelism at the 
 *  level of cores up to the definition of useful programming constructs and patterns.
 *
 *  \image html fastflow_architecture.png
 *
 *  The programmer is exposed to the top layer of the stack of layers, where it is provided with parallel 
 *  programming patterns (a.k.a. \a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_skeleton">skeletons</a>).
 *  They capture common parallel programming paradigms (e.g. \p Map, \p MaReduce, \p ForAll, etc.) and make them 
 *  available to the programmer as high-level programming constructs equipped with well-defined functional and 
 *  extra-functional semantics. FastFlow specifically focuses on Stream Parallelism, and in particular provides:
 * \p farm, \p farm-with-feedback (i.e. Divide&Conquer), \p pipeline, and their arbitrary nesting and 
 *  composition.

 *  \li ff::ff_farm - farm.hpp
 *  \li ff::ff_node - node.hpp
 *
 *
 *  \subsection comp_sec FastFlow is fast.
 *
 *  FastFlow has been used in a number of applications; they typically exhibit a better or similar 
 *  performance compared with their counterparts developed using state-of-the-art programming frameworks 
 *  (e.g. Intel TBB, Cilk, OpenMP)-
