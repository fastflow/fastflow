In order to compile the doxygen configuration file (FastFlow_doxygen)
you need to install Doxygen following this links

http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc

Once doxygen is installed in your machine type 

$ doxygen FastFlow_doxygen

doxygen will compile the existing documentation according to the 
configuration specified and will produce its outputs in the 'doc/' 
folder, in a 'html/' and 'latex/' folder, respectively.

It is configured to produce html and latex output. More are available.

In order to see the html documentation generated, open with a browser 
the file 'index.html' inside the 'html/' folder.

In order to see the latex documentation, open the 'latex/' folder and
run 'make'. This will compile the latex sources and generate the 
'refman.pdf' file, which is the actual reference manual.
