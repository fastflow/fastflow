INSTALL DOXYGEN:

Make sure that doxygen is installed on your machine. You can download doxygen
from given link. http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html#latestsrc

NOTE: mac users can use macports sudo port install doxygen

COMPILATION:
In order to generate documentation files using doxygen type: 

$ doxygen FastFlow_doxygen

doxygen will compile the existing documentation according to the configuration
file (i.e. FastFlow_doxygen). The output is produced in 'doc/' folder. We have
two types of output i.e. 'html' and 'latex'. We can configure to generate more
kind of outputs. 

In order to see the html documentation, open 'html/index.hmtl' in a browser.

In order to see the latex documentation, go to the 'latex/' folder and run
'make'. This will compile the latex sources and generate the 'refman.pdf' file,
which is the actual reference manual.

*****************************************************

We give a little more detail to the developer of documentation.

1) Manual of doxygen can be found in manual
2) The configuration file is Fastflow_doxygen
3) The configuration file for related pages can be found in DoxyPapers
