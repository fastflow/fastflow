   - added the possibility to control the grain size in the static scheduling 
     policy of the ParallelFor(Reduce) pattern(s)

   - a new lock-free task scheduling for the ParallelFor has been implemented. 
     The new scheduling policy is used when the scheduler thread (i.e. farm's emitter 
     thread) is not being started. This scheduling may be enabled at compile time 
     by compiling with the flag -DNO_PARFOR_SCHEDULER_THREAD or at run-time by  
     calling ParallelFor::disableScheduler.
   - added atomic_flag-based spin-lock (only for C++11-compliant compilers) 
   - defined ParallelFor and ParallelForReduce classes
   - removed initial underscore in the preprocessor conditional guards in 
     order to be compliant to the C++ standard
   - more work on parallel_for pattern to avoid starting the scheduler thread
     when there are not enough cores
   - fixed bug in the forall_Scheduler::init_data method

     restart a lower number of workers in a farm having a collector thread.

   - ParallelForReduce optimized for the case when it is called multiple times 
     in a sequential loop
   - fixed possible node termination problem (in case the freezing flag was set)
   - commented out the optimization heuristic in the parallel_for pattern 
     since it does not work well with high unbalanced loop iterations
   - parallel_for/reduce: fixed some issues and optimized the case when it is 
     used with just 1 thread
   - ff_send_out_to modified in order to better work with ondemand scheduling
     policy
   - changed some int types with size_t, moved to svector whenever possible

     to avoid stack corruption on Win platform that requires symmetric 
     primitives for aligned memory allocation and deallocation.
   - Winsock.h (windows.h) and winsock2.h incompatibility issue partially resolved.
     <ff/dnode.h> should be included before other includes to avoid the problem. It

     (useful to collapse in a single thread the Collector and the Emitter 
     in a 2-stage pipeline of 2 farms).

     collector (if present), all workers, emitter; now it is: emitter,
