   - Added multi-output node: ff_monode class inplemented
   - Distributed version ported and tested on Win7 64-bit.
   - little fix on allocator.hpp, freesegment now release aligned memory 
     to avoid stack corruption on Win platform that requires symmetric 
     primitives for aligned memory allocation and deallocation.
   - Winsock.h (windows.h) and winsock2.h incompatibility issue partially resolved.
     <ff/dnode.h> should be included before other includes to avoid the problem. It
	 includes winsock2.h that is required by zeromq.  
* 04/07/12 - v.2.0.0
   - fixed compilation ploblems on Windows 7 64bit using Visual Studio 10
     (cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" ...)
   - added class ff_dinout that allows to have a single dnode with both
     input and output external channels.
   - added the class ff_ofarm to implement the ordered farm template
   - NO_DEFAULT_MAPPING compilation flag added 
   - added the map template that can be used to compute map, map-reduce
     and data-parallel patterns.
   - Added the possibility to have multi-input Emitter in a farm template
     (useful to collapse in a single thread the Collector and the Emitter 
     in a 2-stage pipeline of 2 farms).
   - Changed the thread start order in the farm skeleton. The old one was:
     collector (if present), all workers, emitter; now it is: emitter,
     all workers, and finally the collector (if present).
   - Added the class threadMapper for implementing threads mapping. 
   - Implemented the spinBarrier which has a lower overhead when the 
     number of thread is high.
   - Fixed problems in ffTime and ffwTime for application with nested patterns.
   - The distributed communication patterns implemented so far are: 
     Unicast, Broadcast, Scatter, Gather_All, FromAny, OnDemand

   - moved from int to unsigned long for embedded atomic operations
   - performance improvements in the ff_allocator for the test one to many

     and mp_pop have been added to the dSPSC queue)
* 22/04/11 - v.1.1.1
   - accelerator support implemented for the pipeline
   - ff_send_out improvment: more control over the number of retries, return
     value added
   - barrier protocol re-worked, now is possible to create and to start a 
     pipeline or a farm (or an accelerator) from inside a pipeline's node or 
     a farm's worker/emitter/collector 
   - added ffwTime which considers only the time spent in the svc methods
   - changed the value of FF_GO_ON
   - fixed SWSR_Ptr_Buffer length method (unsigned long --> long)
   - fixed a bug which prevents to have a farm whose workers are D&C skeleton
     (see test_multi_masterworker test)
   - added the possibility to define workers' input queue size for the 
     on-demand scheduling policy (default value is 1 slot)
* 22/04/11 - v.1.1.0
   - MSqueue reworked, now it is not in the experimental state.
     The queue is working also on Windows OS and OSX. Removed DCAS and used CAS.
