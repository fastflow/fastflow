New ideas and features:

- configure 
  by using cmake, still work in progress
- ordered farm (DONE)
  ff_ofarm pattern
- threads mapper (DONE)
  in the release 2.0.0
- more applications 
- deadlock avoidance for skeleton with cycles (DONE)
     The channels are now implemented using by default unbounded queue 
     (ubuffer.hpp)
     Bounded queue can be used by defining FF_BOUNDED_BUFFER in node.hpp.

- add the possibility to define fallback function
  even if there are feedback channels due to 
  master-worker configuration (ABORTED)
- give the possibility to define a user-level 
  collection policy (in the same way as in the scheduling
  policy) (DONE)
- dynamic reconfiguration of the number of workers in the farm pattern
  (ON GOING)
- blocking run-time (using mutex) for coarse-grain applications

Windows version:

- Currently tested only on Windows 7 Visual Studio 10 Win64
- Automatic pinning currently not enabled. Thread id should be made coherent with 1..n Linux vision.
- ZeroMQ is not always automatically detected, install location should be passed to cmake, e.g.

cmake -G"Visual Studio 10 Win64" -DZEROMQ_ROOT="C:\Program Files\ZeroMQ 2.2.0" ..

- Distributed version has not been extensively tested.
- Winsock.h (windows.h) and winsock2.h conflict issue partially solved.
  <ff/dnode.h> should be included before other includes to avoid the problem. 
  It includes winsock2.h that is required by zeromq.  
- opencv and zeromq apparently cannot be mixed. Opencv requires winsock.h, zeromq winsock2.h.
