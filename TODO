- configure
- ordered farm
- threads mapper
- more applications 
- deadlock avoidance for skeleton with cycles (DONE)
     The channels are now implemented using by default unbounded queue 
     (ubuffer.hpp)
     Bounded queue can be used by defining FF_BOUNDED_BUFFER in node.hpp.

- add the possibility to define fallback function
  even if there are feedback channels due to 
  master-worker configuration
- give the possibility to define a user-level 
  collection policy (in the same way as in the scheduling
  policy)
- dynamic reconfiguration of the number of workers in the farm pattern
