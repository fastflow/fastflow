New ideas and features:

- configure 
  by using cmake, still work in progress
- ordered farm (DONE)
  it is sufficient to define a suitable scheduler and gatherer, which distribute
  and collect tasks in the same order. 
- threads mapper (DONE)
  in the release 2.0.0
- more applications 
- deadlock avoidance for skeleton with cycles (DONE)
     The channels are now implemented using by default unbounded queue 
     (ubuffer.hpp)
     Bounded queue can be used by defining FF_BOUNDED_BUFFER in node.hpp.

- add the possibility to define fallback function
  even if there are feedback channels due to 
  master-worker configuration
- give the possibility to define a user-level 
  collection policy (in the same way as in the scheduling
  policy) (DONE)
- dynamic reconfiguration of the number of workers in the farm pattern
  (ON GOING)
- blocking run-time (using mutex) for coarse-grain applications
