/* This is an example showing how to combine the farm and the all-to-all building 
 * blocks for implementing an interesting pattern. It looks like as a logical farm having 
 * pipeline chains as workers. However, in this case the farm has a master-worker configuration 
 * so the scheduler may implement an on-demand policy (or whatever else policy) while 
 * the workers are pipelines implemented by using the L-Worker set of the all-to-all building block. 
 * The collector of the logical farm is implemented by a single R-Worker of the all-to-all.
