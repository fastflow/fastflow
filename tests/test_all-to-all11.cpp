 *
 *  Another way to implement this topology is to split the Emitter in two nodes:
 *  Gatherer and Router, where Gatherer is multi-input and Router is multi-output,
 *  then it is possible to use the comp building block to merge them in one node:
 *
 *     pipe( First, feedback(combine_nodes(Gather,Router), A2A), Last)
 * 
 *  A variant (implemented below) for routing back the data directly to the Emitter2 is to use 
 *  a Gatherer node before the Emitter2 nodes:
 *
 *     pipe( First, Emitter, feedback(A2A), Last)
 *
 *   NOTE: in this case program termination is much more complex to manage because of we could
 *         have more than one workers in the fist set (i.e. more than one Gatherer-Emitter2
 *         composition).
 *

 *                          |___________________________________________________v
 *
 * NOTE: Since Worker is multi-output we need to prepend to such node a multi-input
 *       helper node because a single node cannot be at the same time multi-input
 *       and multi-output (unless that node is a composition of two nodes).
