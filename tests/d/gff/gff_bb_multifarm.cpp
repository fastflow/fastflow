/**
 * 
 * @file        gff_bb_farm.cpp
 * @brief       a simple gff farm with building blocks
 * @author      Maurizio Drocco
 * 
 * This example is a simple farm, in which each component represents
 * a relevant instance of GFF node:
 * - Emitter is a SOURCE node:
 *   it produces a stream (no input channel)
 * - Worker is a (type-changing) FILTER:
 *   it reads an input stream from its input channel and emits an output stream
 *   of different type on its output channel
 * - Collector is a SINK node:
 *   it merges and consumes the streams coming from Workers (no output channel)
 *
 * In this examples, output items from workers are casted to char in order to
 * neutralize any effect of the processing order in the summing collector.
 *

/*
 * To define a gff node, the user has to define first an internal class (a.k.a.
 * dff logic), with the following functions:
 * - svc_init: called once at the beginning of node's execution
 * - svc_end:  called once at the end of node's execution
 * - svc:      called repeatedly during node's execution
 *
 * The signature of svc varies depending on node's family (source, processor,
 * sink). See sample codes.
 *
 * To complete the definition of a gff node, the internal class is passed as
 * template parameter to the generic class corresponding to the node's family.
