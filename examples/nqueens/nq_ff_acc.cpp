 *  Program:  nq
 *  
 *  Program to find number of solutions to the N queens problem.
 *  This program assumes a twos complement architecture.
 *
 *  For example, you can arrange 4 queens on 4 x 4 chess so that
 *  none of the queens can attack each other:
 *
 *  Two solutions:
 *     _ Q _ _        _ _ Q _
 *     _ _ _ Q        Q _ _ _
 *     Q _ _ _        _ _ _ Q
 *     _ _ Q _    and _ Q _ _
 *    
 *  Note that these are separate solutions, even though they
 *  are mirror images of each other.
 *
 *  Likewise, a 8 x 8 chess board has 92 solutions to the 8 queens
 *  problem.
 *
 *  Command Line Usage:
 *
 *          nq N
 *
 *       where N is the size of the N x N board.  For example,
 *       nq 4 will find the 4 queen solution for the 4 x 4 chess
 *       board.
 *
 *  By default, this program will only print the number of solutions,
 *  not board arrangements which are the solutions.  To print the 
 *  boards, uncomment the call to printtable in the Nqueen function.
 *  Note that printing the board arrangements slows down the program
 *  quite a bit, unless you pipe the output to a text file:
 *
 *  nq 10 > output.txt
 *
 *
 *  The number of solutions for the N queens problems are known for
 *  boards up to 23 x 23.  With this program, I've calculated the
 *  results for boards up to 21 x 21, and that took over a week on
 *  an 800 MHz PC.  The algorithm is approximated O(n!) (i.e. slow), 
 *  and calculating the results for a 22 x 22 board will take about 8.5 
 *  times the amount of time for the 21 x 21 board, or over 8 1/2 weeks.
 *  Even with a 10 GHz machine, calculating the results for a 23 x 23 
 *  board would take over a month.  Of course, setting up a cluster of
 *  machines (or a distributed client) would do the work in less time.

/* 
   Notes on MAX_BOARDSIZE:

   A 32 bit unsigned long is sufficient to hold the results for an 18 x 18
   board (666090624 solutions) but not for a 19 x 19 board (4968057848 solutions).
   
   In Win32, I use a 64 bit variable to hold the results, and merely set the
   MAX_BOARDSIZE to 21 because that's the largest board for which I've 
   calculated a result.

   Note: a 20x20 board will take over 20 hours to run on a Pentium III 800MHz,
   while a 21x21 board will take over a week to run on the same PC. 

   On Unix, you could probably change the type of g_numsolutions from unsigned long
   to unsigned long long, or change the code to use two 32 bit ints to store the
   results for board sizes 19 x 19 and up.

/* Algorithm:

   We calculate one-half the solutions, then flip the results over
   the "Y axis" of the board.  Every solution can be reflected that
   way to generate another unique solution (assuming the board size
   isn't 1 x 1).  That's because a solution cannot be symmetrical
   across the Y-axis (because you can't have two queens in the same
   horizontal row).  A solution also cannot consist of queens 
   down the middle column of a board with an odd number of columns,
   since you can't have two queens in the same vertical row.

   This is a backtracking algorithm.  We place a queen in the top
   row, then note the column and diagonals it occupies.  We then 
   place a queen in the next row down, taking care not to place it
   in the same column or diagonal.  We then update the occupied
   columns & diagonals & move on to the next row.  If no position
   is open in the next row, we back track to the previous row & move
   the queen over to the next available spot in its row & the process
   starts over again.
