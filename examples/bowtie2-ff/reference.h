/**
 * Concrete reference representation that bulk-loads the reference from
 * the bit-pair-compacted binary file and stores it in memory also in
 * bit-pair-compacted format.  The user may request reference
 * characters either on a per-character bases or by "stretch" using
 * getBase(...) and getStretch(...) respectively.
 *
 * Most of the complexity in this class is due to the fact that we want
 * to represent references with ambiguous (non-A/C/G/T) characters but
 * we don't want to use more than two bits per base.  This means we
 * need a way to encode the ambiguous stretches of the reference in a
 * way that is external to the bitpair sequence.  To accomplish this,
 * we use the RefRecords vector, which is stored in the .3.ebwt index
 * file.  The bitpairs themselves are stored in the .4.ebwt index file.
 *
 * Once it has been loaded, a BitPairReference is read-only, and is
 * safe for many threads to access at once.
