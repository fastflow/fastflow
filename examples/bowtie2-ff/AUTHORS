---- Bowtie2-ff

Claudia Misale <misale@di.unito.it> and Marco Aldinucci
<aldinuc@di.unito.it> designed and wrote Bowtie2-ff, which is a
porting on the FastFlow framework of the Bowtie 2 code. 

FastFlow: http://mc-fastflow.sourceforge.net/

FastFlow is licenced under LGPLv3. Bowtie2-ff is licenced under GNU
GPL, see license file. 

FastFlow has been originally designed by Marco Aldinucci
<aldinuc@di.unito.it> and Massimo Torquati <torquati@di.unipi.it>. 
Many other researchers and developers contributed to FastFlow
evolution, among the others Marco Danelutto and Peter Kilpatrick (see
FastFlow website for an extensive listing). Massimo Torquati is
currently the main maintainer.  

FastFlow developmented has been partially supported by a number of
grants, including: 

- REPARA (EC-STREP, 7th FP): Reengineering and Enabling Performance
  And poweR of Applications. Grant no. 609666. 
- IMPACT (founded by Compagnia di San Paolo): Innovative Methods for
  Particle Colliders at the Terascale.
- ParaPhrase (EC-STREP, 7th FP): Parallel Patterns for Adaptive
  Heterogeneous Multicore Systems. Grant no. 288570.
- HiPEAC (EC-NoE,7th FP) European Network of Excellence on High
  Performance and Embedded Architecture and Compilation.

Ben Langmead <langmea@cs.jhu.edu> wrote Bowtie 2, which is based partially on
Bowtie.  Bowtie was written by Ben Langmead and Cole Trapnell.

A DLL from the pthreads for Win32 library is distributed with the Win32 version
of Bowtie 2.  The pthreads for Win32 library and the GnuWin32 package have many
contributors (see their respective web sites).

The ForkManager.pm perl module is used in Bowtie 2's random testing framework,
and is included as scripts/sim/contrib/ForkManager.pm.  ForkManager.pm is
written by dLux (Szabo, Balazs), with contributions by others.  See the perldoc
in ForkManager.pm for the complete list.

The file ls.h includes an implementation of the Larsson-Sadakane suffix sorting
algorithm.  The implementation is by N. Jesper Larsson and was adapted somewhat
for use in Bowtie 2.

Various users have kindly supplied patches, bug reports and feature requests
over the years.  Many, many thanks go to them.
