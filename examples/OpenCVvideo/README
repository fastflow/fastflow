To compile this simple video app, you need the OpenCV library.

In case OpenCV is installed in a non-standard directory, (for example in /opt/OpenCV), please
make sure that the 'pkg-config' command is able to find the proper OpenCV installation dir. 

Under Linux bash you can simply use:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/OpenCV/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
