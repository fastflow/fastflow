This is a simple utility to check a Cholesky decomposition correctness.

It takes in input two matrices saved in two files and print on screen the differences between the two matrices.

Start the program as following:

./check <dim> <file1> <file2> <threshold exp>

Where the arguments are:

dim: size of the matrix
file1: name (with absolute or relative path) of the first file
file2: name (with absolute or relative path) of	the second file
threshold exp: threshold of error expressed as an exponent of 10 power

In example you can check the correctness of a 10x10 matrix factorization with 0.001 precision in the following way:

./check 10 ./matrix1.txt ./matrix2.txt -3
