Installation Instructions
*************************
We assume you have installed Boost libraries together with your system libraries.
If they are located somewhere else, you should edit some lines of the Makefile.



* Installation steps:
1. (optional) edit Makefile to fit your environment

2. Compile:
- (hybrid version) make HYBRID=yes 
- (stochastic version) make

Now you have an executable named scwc.
